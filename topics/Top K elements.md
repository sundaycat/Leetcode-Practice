## Top K Elements

### **Overview**:  
Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent **K** elements among a given set falls under this pattern. The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of **K** elements is Heap.

+ sometimes, we use dictionary to count the frequency of elements.


### Problem set 1
+ [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array][1]
+ [378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix][2]
+ [973. K Closest Points to Origin][3]
+ [1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks][4]
+ [347. Top K Frequent Elements][5]
+ [451. Sort Characters By Frequency][6]
+ [703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream][7]
+ [658. Find K Closest Elements][8]
+ [Max Number of Unique Integers after K removals][9]
+ [1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals][10]
+ [767. Reorganize String][11] - Need more practice
+ [358. Rearrange String k Distance Apart][12]
+ [621. Task Scheduler][13]
+ [895. Maximum Frequency Stack][14]
