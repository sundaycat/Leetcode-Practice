## Problem List of Two Pointer ##
### **Overview**:   
Deal with **sorted** arrays(or LinkedList) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints.

The two pointer technique is a useful tool to utilize when searching for pairs in a sorted array. As the two pointer implies, there are two pointers of consideration and they both (usually) move towards the middle of the data being iterated over

### Problem set 1
+ [026. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array][1]
+ [027. Remove Elements][2]
+ [977. Squares of a Sorted Array][3]
+ [015. 3Sum][4]
+ [016. 3Sum cloest][5]
+ [259. 3sum Smaller][6]
+ [713. Subarry Product Less than K][7] 
    + solution 1: slide window + two pointer
    + solution 2: log + binary search
    + follow up question: Find all of its contiguous subarrays instead of just counts.
+ [075. Sort Color][8]
