## Problem List of slow & faster pointer ##

### **Overview**:   

The Fast & slow pointer approach is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointer which move through the array(or sequence, linkedlist et) at different speeds. By moving at different speeds toward the same direction in a cyclic linkedlist, the two pointers are bound to meet.

### Problem set 1
+ [141. linked list cycle][1]
+ [202. happy number][2]
+ [876. middle of the linked list][3]

### Problem set 2
+ [234. palindrome linkedlist][4]
+ [143. reorder list][5]
+ [457. circular array loop][6]
    + [Follow Up][7]: If we can remember all the numbers that have been visited, our algorithm will improve to O(N). It is similar to detect loop in a dirtected graph using DFS (MIT 6.006 Lecture 14).
