### [**Q1**][1]: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.

**problem analysis**
1. Start by pushing the root node to the queue.
2. Keep iterating until the queue is empty.
3. In each iteration, 
    - First count the elements in the queue (let’s call it levelSize). We will have these many nodes in the current level.
    - Next, remove levelSize nodes from the queue and push their value in an array to represent the current level.
4. After removing each node from the queue, insert both of its children into the queue.
5. If the queue is not empty, repeat from step 3 for the next level.

**corner case analysis**
root == Null: return Null

**complexity analysis**
1. time complexity: O(N), visited each node only once
2. space complexity: O(N)
O(N) space for the returning list. Maximum of N/2 space for the queue to store any level nodes(it could happen only at the loweest level). Therefore, the total sapce complexity is O(N + N/2) = O(N)

``` python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left =  None
        self.right = None
    
def traverse(root):

    if root is None:
        return []

    rs = []
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    while queue:

        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        for i in range(level_size):

            # pop out the left node and add it to current level
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.val)

            # insert the children of current node to the queue
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        rs.append(current_level)
    
    return rs
```

### [**Q2**][2]: Zigzag Traversal

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its zigzag level order traversal. You should populate the values of **all nodes of the first level from left to right, then right to left for the next level** and keep alternating in the same manner for the following levels

**problem analysis**
从左到右按层将元素压入队列中, 弹出后, 按traverse direction压入current_level

**case analysis**
1. from left to right: node -> deque.popleft(); deque.append(node.val)
2. from right to left: node -> deque.popleft(); deque.appendleft(node.val)

``` python
def traverse(root):
    
    rs = []
    if root is None:
        return []
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    left_to_right = True
    while queue:

        current_level = deque()
        level_size = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_size):

            node = queue.popleft()

            # 从左到右按层将元素压入队列中, 弹出后, 按traverse direction压入current_level
            if left_to_right:
                current_level.append(node.val)
            else:
                current_level.appendleft(node.val)
            
            # insert the children of current node in the queue
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        rs.append(list(current_level))

        # reverse the traversal direction
        left_to_right = not left_to_right

    return rs
```

### [**Q3**][3]: Level Averages in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent **the averages of all of its levels**.

``` python
def find_level_averages(root):

    rs = []
    if root is None:
        return rs
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    while queue:
        # make sure the result of division is floating type
        level_sum = 0.0
        level_size = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_sum += node.val

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        rs.append(level_sum / level_size)
    
    return rs
```

### [**Q4**][4]: Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree

Find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the **shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node**.

**problem analysis**
Instead of keeping track of all the nodes in a level, we will only track the depth of the tree. As soon as we find our first leaf node, that level will represent the minimum depth of the tree.

``` python
def find_minimum_depth(root):

    if root is None:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    
    min_depth = 0
    while queue:

        min_depth += 1
        level_size = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_size):

            node = queue.popleft()

            # check if this is a leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return min_depth
            
            # insert the children of current node in the queue
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
```

### Q5: Level Order Successor

Given a binary tree and a node, find the level order successor of the given node in the tree. The level order successor is the node that appears right after the given node in the level order traversal.

**problem analysis**

We will not keep track of all the levels. Instead we will keep inserting child nodes to the queue. As sson as we find the given node, we will return the next node from the queue as the level order successor.

``` python
def find_successort(root, key):

    if root is None:
        return None
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    while queue:

        node = queue.popleft()

        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
        
        # break if we find the key
        if node.val == key:
            break
    
    return queue[0] if queue else None
```

### [**Q6**][6]: Connect Level Order Siblings

Given a binary tree, connect each node with its level order successor. The last node of each level should point to a null node.

**case analysis**
1. i + 1 == level_size: node = queue.popleft(); node.next = None
2. i + 1 <  level_size: node = queue.popleft(); node.next = queue[0]

``` python
def connect_level_order_siblings(root):

    if root is None:
        return None

    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    while queue:

        level_size = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            # connect the nodes on the same level
            if i + 1 == level_size:
                node.next = None
            else:
                node.next = queue[0]
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
```

# Challenge Problems

### Q1: Connect All Level Order Siblings

Given a binary tree, connect each node with its level order successor. The last node of each level should point to the first node of the next level.

**case analysis**
1. the queue is not empty: node = queue.popleft(); node.next = queue[0]
2. the queue is empty(reach the last leaf node): node = queue.popleft(); node.next = None

``` python
def connect_all_siblings(root):

    if root is None:
        return root
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)

    while queue:
        
        node = queue.popleft()

        # insert the children node into queue first
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
        
        # connect to the next node later
        if queue:
            node.next = queue[0]
        else:
            # handle the last node
            node.next = None
    
    return
```

### [**Q2**][7]: Right View of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return an array containing nodes in its right view. The right view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is seen from the right side.

``` python
def tree_right_view(root):

    if root is None:
        return []
    
    rs = []
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(root)
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            if i + 1 == level_size:
                rs.append(node)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

    return rs
```
