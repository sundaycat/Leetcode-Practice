# Fast & Slow Pointer

The Fast & slow pointer approach is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointer which move through the array(or sequence, linkedlist et) at **different speeds**.

By moving at different speeds toward **the same direction** in a cyclic linkedlist, the two pointers are bound to meet. 

### [Q1][1]: Detect Cycle in LinkedList

Given the head of a **Singly LinkedList**, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.

Imagine we have a slow and a fast pointer to traverse the LinkedList. In each iteration, the slow pointer moves one step and the fast pointer moves two steps. This gives us the following conclusions:

+ If the LinkedList doest't have a cycle in it, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linkedlist before the slow pointer to reveal that there is no cycle in the linkedlist
+  The slow pointer will never be able to catch up the fast pointer if there is no cycle in the LinkedList.
+ If the fast pointer is a few steps behind the slow pointer in a cyclic LinkedList, after each move, it will be **2 - 1** less steps behind the slow pointer. After a few step, it will finally catch up the slow pointer.

``` python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next = None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
    
def has_cycle(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast.next and fast.next.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
        
    return False
```

Time complexity: O(N), Space complexity: O(1)

#### Follow up: Lenght of loop in linkedlist

Given the head of a LinkedList with a cycel, find the length of the cycle

1. locate the cycle postion in the list
2. calculate its length.
   
``` python
def find_circle_length(head):
    fast, slow = head, head
    while fast.next and fast.next.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if fast == slow:
            return calculate_circle_length(slow)        

def calculate_circle_length(slow):
    cur = slow.next
    count = 1
    while cur != slow:
        count += 1
        cur = cur.next
    
    return count
```

### [Q2][2]: Happy Number

Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to number ‘1’. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach ‘1’. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers which does not include ‘1’.    

Example: Input 23, we have
\[
    2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\
    1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \\
    1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 01
\]


+ What if fast did not reach 1 and did not detect a cycle
+ corner case num = 1

``` python
def find_happy_number(num):

    fast = slow = num
    while True:
    
        slow = cal_square_number(slow)
        fast = cal_square_number(fast)
        fast = cal_square_number(fast)
        
        # put fast == 1 first to avoid the corner case num = 1
        if fast == 1: return True
        if slow == fast: return False
        
def cal_square_number(num):
    square = 0
    while num != 0:
        square += (num % 10) ** 2
        num //= 10
    
    return square
```

### [Q3][3]: Middle of the LinkedList

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to return the middle node of the LinkedList.

``` python
def find_middle_of_linked_list(head):

    if not head: return None

    # 需要考虑到链条节点为奇数和偶数两种情况
    fast, slow = head, head
    
    # 'while fast' makes sure fast is point to a real node
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
    return slow
```

# **Problem Challenge**

### [Q1][4]: Palindrome LinkedList

Given the head of a singly LinkedList, write a method to check if the LinkedList is a palindrome or not.

1. Using the **Fast & Slow pointers** method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.
2. Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half.
3. Then, we will compare the first half with the reversed second half to see if the LinkedList represents a palindrome.
4. Finally, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList again to revert and bring the LinkedList back to its original form.

``` python

def reverse(head):
    prev = None
    while head:
        next = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = next
    
    return prev

def is_palidromic_linked_list(head):

    # corner cases
    if not head or not head.next: return True

    # find the middle of the LinkedList
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
    
    # reverse the second half and store the head of reversed part to revert back later
    latter_half = reverse(slow)
    copy_latter_half = latter_half

    # compare the first and the second half
    while head and latter_half:
        # cannot return immediately since we need to restore the linkedlist later
        if head.value != latter_half.value:
            break

        head = head.next
        latter_half = latter_half.next
    
    # revert the reverse of the second half
    reverse(copy_latter_half)

    # if both halves match, return true.
    if head is None or latter_half is None:
        return True
    
    return False
```
Time complexity: O(N)

### [Q2][5]: Rearrange a LinkedList
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the **nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order**. So if the LinkedList

<pre>
            1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null
                            <=>
            1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null
</pre>

Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.

1. We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.
2. Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.
3. Finally, we’ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the required order.

``` python
def reorder(head):

    if not head or not head.next: return head

    # find the middle node of the linked list
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
    
    # reverse the second half list
    tail = reverse(slow)

    # start reordering the nodes, end condition is tail.next is None
    while tail.next:
        
        # saves the next head and tail first
        head_next = head.next
        tail_prev = tail.next

        # reorder, start from tail then the head
        tail.next = head.next
        head.next = tail

        # move head and tail forward
        head = head_next
        tail = tail_prev


def reverse(head):
    prev = None
    while head:
        next = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = next

    return prev
```
Time complexity: O(N), Space complexity: O(1)

### [Q3][6]: Cycle in a Circular Array
We are given an array containing positive and negative numbers. Suppose the array contains a number ‘M’ at a particular index. Now, if ‘M’ is positive we will move forward ‘M’ indices and if ‘M’ is negative move backwards ‘M’ indices. You should assume that the array is circular which means two things:

+ If, while moving forward, we reach the end of the array, we will jump to the first element to continue the movement.
+ If, while moving backward, we reach the beginning of the array, we will jump to the last element to continue the movement.

Write a method to determine if the array has a cycle. The cycle should have more than one element and should follow one direction which means the cycle should not contain both forward and backward movements.

<pre>
Example: 

    2, -1, 1, 2, 2      => idx: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0    => True
    1, -1, 1, 2, 2      => idx: 0 -> 1 -> 0         => False
    -1, -2, -3, -4, -5  => idx: 0 -> 4 -> 4         => False     

</pre>

This problem involves finding a cycle in the array and, as we know, the Fast & Slow pointer method is an efficient way to do that. We can start from each index of the array to find the cycle. If a number does not have a cycle we will move forward to the next element. There are a couple of additional things we need to take care of:

1. 是否同向
2. 循环里是否只包含了一个元素(即计算出来的新坐标与前一个坐标相同)

``` python
def circular_array_loop_exists(arr):

    # outer loop to iterate through the element of array
    for idx in range(len(arr)):

        # remembering the direction of each element while searching for the cycle
        direction = (arr[idx] >= 0)
        fast = slow = idx
        while True:
            
            pre_idx = fast
            fast = (fast + arr[fast]) % len(arr)
            if not move_foward(direction, pre_idx, fast, arr): break
            
            pre_idx = fast
            fast = (fast + arr[fast]) % len(arr)
            if not move_foward(direction, pre_idx, fast, arr): break
            
            slow = (slow + arr[slow]) % len(arr) 

            if fast == slow:
                return True
    
    return False

# 1.方向是否一致  2.是否只包含了一个元素
def move_foward(direction, pre_idx, cur_idx, arr):

    keep_moving = True

    # check if the idx is moving foward the same direction
    if (arr[cur_idx] >= 0) != direction:
        keep_moving = False
    
    # check if there exist one element cycle
    if pre_idx == cur_idx:
        keep_moving = False

    return keep_moving
```

Time complexity: O($N^2$), Space Complexity: O(1)

**Follow Up**: In our algorithm, we don’t keep a record of all the numbers that have been evaluated for cycles. We know that all such numbers will not produce a cycle for any other instance as well. If we can remember all the numbers that have been visited, our algorithm will improve to O(N) as, then, each number will be evaluated for cycles only once. We can keep track of this by creating a separate array, however, in this case, the space complexity of our algorithm will increase to O(N).
