# Cylic Sort

An interesting approach to deal with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

循环排序(Cyclic sort或Cycle sort)。这是一种非常有用的解决这种数组：包含的数字在给定数组的长度范围内，寻找缺失或重复的数字问题的方法。

每一个元素都可以作为数组的下标(下标从0开始)。那么就可以依次遍历该数组，每次的元素和它的值对应的下标找到的元素交换，直到该下标的值和下标相等为止。这样最终可以得到一个下标值和元素相等的，排序好的数组。如果遇到大于数组长度的数，或其它不满足范围[0, length)长度的元素(负数)，直接忽略掉。

同样的问题也可以使用快慢指针解决, 好处是不会改变数据原来排序.

#### [Q1][1]: Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**example**: 
<pre>
Input: nums = [3,0,1]         Output: 2

Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

**problem analysis**

There are a one-to-one correspondence between the index and value except for the last value `n` given the fact below:
>range of index: 0 ~ n - 1
>range of value: 0 ~ n 

We iterate the array one number at a time, and if the current number we are iterating is not at the correct index, we swap it with the number at its correct index. This way, we will go through all numbers and place them at their correct indices, hence, sorting the whole array and then we walked throught the sorted array and find out the missing number.

**case analysis**

1. if current index != current value, then swap the value to its correct index
    1.1 keep swapping until the correct value is swapped into the current index position
2. if current index == current value, then move to next element
3. iterate through the sorted array and find the missing number.

``` Python
class Solution:

    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):

            # num[i] as an array index is proctectd by the condiction nums[i] < len(nums). 
            # hence, it is safe to use nums[i] as index to swap the elements.
            if nums[i] < len(nums) and nums[i] != nums[nums[i]]:
                # nums[nums[i]],  nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]]
                temp = nums[nums[i]]
                nums[nums[i]] = nums[i]
                nums[i] = temp
            else:
                # keep swapping until the correct value is swapped to current index pos.
                # and then move to to next position.
                i += 1
        
        # the corner case i == n can be handle by the condition len(nums) + 1
        for i in range(len(nums):
            if i != nums[i]:
                return i
        
        return len(nums)

```

#### [Q2][2]: Find all missing Numbers

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

**problem analysis**

There are a one-to-one correspondence between the index and value given fact below
>range of index: 0 ~ n - 1
>range of value: 1 ~ n 

It is similar to question 1 except one difference that we need to deal with the duplicate elements. Once we detect a value that is not in the correct index, we also need to check if the value is the same as the value in the index that it is about to swapped. If it is, then we stop swapping and move to next index. Otherwise swap them.

**case analysis**
1. if current value not in correct index `i != nums[i] - 1` and the value we about to swap with is not equal to the current value `nums[i] != nums[j]`, swapped them.
2. if current value in the correct index or it equals to the value it is about to swapped, then skip it and move to next index ()
3. iterate through the sorted array and find all the missing numbers.

``` python
class Solution:

    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        i, rs = 0, []
        while i < len(nums):
            '''
            1. i != j means the current value we are iterating is not at the correct index
            2. num[i] != nums[j] means is to avoid dead loop cause by duplicate values.
            '''
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if i != j and nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1
    
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] - 1 != i:
                rs.append(i + 1)

        return rs
```

#### [Q3][3]: Find the duplication Numbers

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number. You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space

**problem analysis**

There are a one-to-one correspondence  between the index and value except the last nth index given fact below
>range of index: 0 ~ n
>range of value: 1 ~ n 

If the current number we are iterating is not at the correct index and its value is equal to the index that it is about to swaped with, then we found the duplicate element.

[fast/slow algorithm solution][5]: linkedlist loop + find the start of the loop.

**case analysis**

1. if current value not in correct index && current value != swapped value, then swap the elements
2. if current value in correct index, then
    + 2.1 if current value == swapped value, then we find the duplicate and return
    + 2.2 if current value != swapped value, then we move to next index

``` python
class Solution:

    # solution 1
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if i != j:
                # there is only one duplicate. thus we return as we find it
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    return nums[i]
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i] #swap
                
            else:
                i += 1

        return - 1 
    
    # solution 2: linkedlist loop + floyde's algorithm(find the start of the loop) - fast/slow pointer
     def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    

        # find the meeting point where slow/fast pointer meets
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]
            fast = nums[fast]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        # find the start of the loop
        slow2 = 0
        while slow != slow2:
            slow = nums[slow]
            slow2 = nums[slow2]
        
        return slow

#### [Q4][4]: Find all duplicate Numbers

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

**problem analysis**

There are a one-to-one correspondence  between the index and value given the fact below
>range of index: 0 ~ n - 1
>range of value: 1 ~ n 

It is similar to the questions above and for the duplicate ones, they will be swapped to the positions that correspond to the missing numbers. Hence, we can iterate through the sorted list and pick out the value in the ones that index doesn't match its value.

**case analysis**
1. sorted it in cylic way. 
2. iterate over the sorted array and pick up the duplicate elements

``` python
def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # sort in cylic way and the dulicate ones will be move to the position corresponding to 
        # the missing numbers.
        i, rs = 0, []
        while i != len(nums):
            
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if i != j and nums[i] != nums[j]: 
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1

        # iterate through the sorted array and pick out the duplicate numbers
        for k in range(len(nums)):
            if k != nums[k] - 1:
                rs.append(nums[k])

        return rs
```

# Problem Challenge

#### [Q1][6]: Find the corrupt pair
We are given an unsorted array containing ‘n’ numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. The array originally contained all the numbers from 1 to ‘n’, but due to a data error, one of the numbers got duplicated which also resulted in one number going missing. Find both these numbers.

```python
def find_corrupt_numbers(nums):

    i, rs = 0, []
    while i < len(nums):

        j = nums[i] - 1
        if i != j and nums[i] != nums[j]:
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        else:
            i += 1

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i != nums[i] - 1:
            rs.extend([nums[i], i + 1])

    return rs
```

#### [Q2][7]: First Missing Positive
Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.
**example**
<pre>Input: nums = [1,2,0]  Output: 3</pre>
**Case analysis**: skip the case that 
1. value larger than current length
2. value is negative
3. current value is not in the correct index
4. current value is duplicate with the value it is about to swap with.

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):

            j = nums[i] - 1
            if nums[i] <= len(nums) and j >= 0 and i != j and nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1

        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):

            if  i == len(nums) or i != nums[i] - 1:
                return i + 1
        
        return -1
```

#### [Q3][8]: Find the first k missing positive
Given an unsorted array containing numbers and a number ‘k’, find the first ‘k’ missing positive numbers in the array.

**example:**
<pre>
Example 1: Input: [3, -1, 4, 5, 5], k=3 
Output: [1, 2, 6] 
Explanation: The smallest missing positive numbers are 1, 2 and 6.

Example 2: Input: [2, 3, 4], k=3 
Output: [1, 5, 6]. 
Explanation: The smallest missing positive numbers are 1, 5 and 6.
</pre>

**problem analysis**
1. cylic sort the array and iterate through array to find indices that doesn't have correct numbers.
2. If we are not able to find ‘k’ missing numbers from the array, we need to add additional numbers to the output array. One tricky aspect is that any of these additional numbers could be part of the array. Remember, while sorting, we ignored all numbers that are greater than or equal to the length of the array. So all indices that have the missing numbers could possibly have these additional numbers. 

for example: nums: [2, 1, 3, 6, 5], k =2. After the cyclic sort our array will look like: nums: [1, 2, 3, 6, 5]. From the sorted array we can see that the first missing number is 4 (as we have 6 on the fourth index) but to find the second missing number we need to remember that the array does contain 6. Hence, the next missing number is 7.

``` Python
def find_first_k_missing_positive(nums, k):

    extra_nums = set()
    i, rs = 0, []
    while i < len(nums):

        j = nums[i] - 1
        if nums[i] > 0 and nums[i] <= len(nums) and i != j and nums[i] != nums[j]:
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        else:
            # while sorting the array, we ignore all numbers that are greater than the array length.
            # However, those ignored numbers could possibly be some of the additional numbers.
            if nums[i] > len(nums):
                extra_nums.add(nums[i])
            i += 1
    
    for i in range(len(nums) + k):
        
        if k == 0: break

        # find the missing positive that greater than the array length and 
        if i >= len(nums) and i + 1 not in extra_nums:
            rs.append(i + 1)
            k -= 1
        
        # find the missing positive that less than the array length
        if i < len(nums) and i != nums[i] - 1:
            rs.append(i + 1)
            k -= 1

    return rs
```
