# **In-place Reversal of a LinkedList**

To reverse the links between a set of nodes of a linkedList in an efficient way that costs no extra memory.

### [**Q1**][1]: Reverse a singly linkedList

Given the head of a singly LinkedList, reverse the LinkedList. Return the new head of the reversed LikedList.

**Note**: 
1. 先保存链接, 在断掉链接

```python
from __future__ import print_function

class Node:

    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
    
    def print_list(self):
        temp = self
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp.value, end=" ")
            temp = temp.next
        print() 

def reverse(head):

    pre, cur, next = None, head, None
    while cur is not None:
        
        # save the link before cutting it off
        next = cur.next
        cur.next = pre
        pre = cur
        cur = next

    return pre
```
Space Complexity: O(N)

### [**Q2**][2]: Reverse a Sub-list

Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions 'p' and 'q', reverse the linkedlist form position 'p' to 'q'.

**problem analysis**:
we are interested in three parts of the LinkedList, the part before index 'p', the part between 'p' and 'q' and the part after index 'q'

1. Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p.
2. Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
3. Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
4. Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.

**cases analysis**:
when reversing and reconnect the sub-list, we need to consider the following cases:

1. p = 1 -> pre_p_node == Null: head = pre; p_node.next = cur
2. p > 1 -> pre_p_node != Null: pre_p_node = pre; p_node_next = cur

**complexity**:
1. time complexity: O(N)
2. space complexity: O(1)

```python
# left close, right open. [ ), in this way, we can track the pos of pre easily
def reverse_sub_list(head, p, q):

    # found the position, after the loop, cur will point to the p node
    count = 0
    pre, cur = None, head
    while cur and count < p - 1:
        pre = cur
        cur = cur.next
        count += 1

    # save the last node of first part and first node of the reverse list
    pre_p_node, p_node = pre, cur

    # reverse in between p, q, 包括了pre_p_node, p_node的reverse.之后可以纠正回来
    next = None
    while cur and count < q:
        next = cur.next
        cur.next = pre
        pre = cur
        cur = next
        count += 1
    
    # linke the pre p - 1 and the rest of the q + 1 - end nodes
    p_node.next = cur
    if pre_p_node:
        pre_p_node.next = pre
    else:
        head = pre

    return head
```

### [**Q3**][3]: Reverse every K-element sub-list

Given the head of a linked list and a number 'k', reverse every 'k' sized sub-list starting from the head.

**problem analysis**
Apply the same approach, starting with the first sub-list(p = 1, q = k). After each round, reset the pre pointer to the pre_node of the new sub-list.

```python
def reverse_every_k_elements(head, k):

    if k <= 1:
        return head

    pre, cur = None, head
    while cur:

        pre_sub_node, sub_node = pre, cur

        i = 0
        next = None
        while cur and i < k:
            next = cur.next
            cur.next = pre
            pre = cur
            cur = next
            i += 1
        
        sub_node.next = cur
        if pre_sub_node:
            pre_sub_node.next = pre
        else:
            head = pre
        
        pre = sub_node
    
    return head
```

### Q4: Reverse alternating K-element sub_list

**problem analysis**
In each iteration after reversing k elements, we will skip the next 'k' elements

**complexity**
1. time complexity: O(N)
2. space complexzity: O(1)

```python
def reverse_alternate_k_elements(head, k):

    pre, cur = None, head
    while cur:

        pre_sub_node, sub_node = pre, cur

        i = 0
        next = None
        while cur and i < k:
            next = cur.next
            cur.next = pre
            pre = cur
            cur = next
            i += 1
                   
        sub_node.next = cur
        if pre_sub_node:
            pre_sub_node.next = pre
        else:
            head = pre
        
        pre = sub_node

        # skip the next k elements
        i = 0
        while cur and i < k:
            pre = cur
            cur = cur.next
            i += 1

    return head
```

### [**Q5**][4]: Rotate a LinkedList

Given the head of a singly LinkedList and a number 'k', rotate the LinkedList to the right by 'k' nodes.

**problem analysis:**
1. Find the list length and the tail node
2. calcuate the effective number of rotations and find the position of new list's tail node.
3. reconect the node to form the new rotated linkedlist.

**corner case analysis**
1. head is None: return head
2. head.next is None: merge into generate case
3. rotations <= 0: return head

**complexity analysis**
1. space complexity: O(N)
2. time complexity: O(1)

``` python
def rotate(head, rotations):

    if head is None or head.next is None or rotations <= 0:
        #return head

    # find list length and tail node
    length, tail = 1, head
    while tail.next:
        length += 1
        tail = tail.next

    # rotate the linkedlist, (rotations % length) is the effective number of rotations
    pos = length - (rotations % length)
    new_tail = head
    while pos > 1:
        new_tail = new_tail.next
        pos -= 1

    # conects the tail with head first
    tail.next = head

    head = new_tail.next
    new_tail.next = None

    return head
```
