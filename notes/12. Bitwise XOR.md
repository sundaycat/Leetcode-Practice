# Bitwise XOR

+ **XOR 定义**

                            |  A  |   B |  A XOR B  |
                            |:---:|:---:|:---------:|
                            |  0  |  0  |     0     |
                            |  0  |  1  |     1     |
                            |  1  |  0  |     1     |
                            |  1  |  1  |     0     |

+ **XOR 性质** 
    <br>
    1. Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0. Ex: `29 ^ 29 = 0`
    2. Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number. Ex: `1 ^ 0 = 1`
    3.  XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:<br>
        + `(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)`
        + `a ^ b = b ^ a`

### [Q2][2]: Single number

**case analysis**

Recall the following two properties of XOR:

1. It returns zero if we take XOR of two same numbers.
2. It returns the same number if we XOR with zero.

So we can XOR all the numbers in the input; duplicate numbers will zero out each other and we will be left with the single number.

### [Q3][3]: Two Single Numbers 

**case analysis**
1. Taking XOR of all numbers in the given array will give us XOR of num1 and num2, calling this XOR as n1xn2.
2. Find any bit which is set in n1xn2. We can take the rightmost bit which is ‘1’. Let’s call this rightmostSetBit.
3. Iterate through all numbers of the input array to partition them into two groups based on rightmostSetBit. Take XOR of all numbers in both the groups separately. Both these XORs are our required numbers.

### [Q4][4]: Complement of based 10

**case analysis**

Given number: 101, its one's complement(反码) is 010. Then
    
>number ^ one's complement = 101 ^ 010 = 111 = all bits set.

Let us add 'number' on both side, we have

> number ^ number ^ one's complement 
    = number ^ all bits set 
    = 101 ^ 101 ^ 010 = 010 
    = one's complement

That is, `one's complement = number ^ all bits set`.

Solution:

1. find the number of binary bit that need to represent a number
2. generate the all set bits with the given binary bit
3. calcuate its complement by number xor all bits set

### [Q5][5]: Flipping an Image 

**case analysis**

1. **Flip**: We can flip the image in place by replacing ith element from left with the ith element from the right.

2. **Invert**: We can take XOR of each element with 1. If it is 1 then it will become 0 and if it is 0 then it will become 1
