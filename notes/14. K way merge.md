# K Way Merge

This pattern helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays.

Whenever we are given ‘K’ sorted arrays, we can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays. We can push the smallest (first) element of each sorted array in a Min Heap to get the overall minimum. While inserting elements to the Min Heap we keep track of which array the element came from. We can, then, remove the top element from the heap to get the smallest element and push the next element from the same array, to which this smallest element belonged, to the heap. We can repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.

### [Q1][1]: Merge K Sorted Lists 

Given an array of ‘K’ sorted LinkedLists, merge them into one sorted list.

<pre>
Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]
</pre>

**case analysis**
solution 1: min heap, O(nlogk), where n is the nnumber of nodes and k is number of list. Note, the lt operator is overloaded in the ListNode.


1. push the first node of each linkedlist into a min heap.
2. pop out the smallest(top) node from the heap and links it to the merged list.
3. push the next element of the same list into the min heap.
4. continue 2, 3 until the heap is empty

solution 2: divide and conquer, see the code file.

**complexity analysis**
+ time complexity: O(nlogk)

``` Python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
    
    def __lt__(self, others):
        return self.val < others.val


class Solution:

    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # put the first node of each linked list to form a min heap of size k
        minHeap = []
        for i in range(len(lists)):
            node = lists[i]
            heappush(minHeap, node)
        
        dummy = cur = ListNode()
        while minHeap:
            
            node = heappop(minHeap)
            
            # linked the current node to resultant linkedlist and move the cur to next
            cur.next = node
            cur = cur.next

            # push next node in the current linkedlist to the heap
            if node.next:
                # save the current node's next and set it to None
                heappush(minHeap, node.next)

        return dummy.next
```


### [Q2][2]: Kth Smallest Number in a Sorted Matrix

Given an N x N matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order, find the Kth smallest element in the matrix.

**case analysis**
 
solution: using heap
1. push the first element of each row into a min heap
2. pop out the smallest element(top) from current heap
3. push the next element of the same row into the min heap.
4. continue 2, 3 until we reach kth element

**complexity analysis**
+ Time complexity: O(Klog(row)), where row is len(matrix)
+ Space Complexity: O(row)

``` python
from heqpq import *

class Solution:

    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        
        # add the first element into the heap
        minHeap = []
        for row in range(len(matrix)):
            item = (matrix[row][0], row, 0)
            heappush(minHeap, item)

        count = 0
        while minHeap:       
            
            (val, row, col) = heappop(minHeap)

            count += 1
            if count == k: return val

            if col + 1 < len(matrix[0]):
                item = (matrix[row][col + 1], row, col + 1)
                heappush(minHeap, item)
        
        return -1    


```
